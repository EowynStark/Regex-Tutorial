# Regex-Tutorial
A tutorial explaining how to understand a regular expression built to match a url 

## Summary

In this tutorial we will be examining the regular expression that defines how we Match a URL in a search. 
The regular expression is as follows:
Matching a URL: `/^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$/`

When we utilize this expression in our code it allows us to check against any user input and match it with the set parameters of the expression itself. It may look like a collection of random characters bashed together, but each part has a purpose. Later in this tutorial we will be dissecting and learning how this particular expression helps us match user input to the parameters hidden in the regular expression above.
